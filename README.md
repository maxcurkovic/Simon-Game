# Max Curkovic's Simon Game

This website serves as a recreation of the classic memory game "Simon", written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS code. 
Below are the rules of the game, taken from: 

*"The principle of the game is simple: the player have to memorize the series of illuminated keys and reproduce it. The purpose of the game is to reproduce the longest series of colors / sounds randomly generated by the Simon.
In each round a new key is added to the series and the game becomes increasingly difficult because the player's memory is more and more solicited.

1- At the beginning of the game, one of the 4 keys lights up randomly producing simultaneously a sound associated to the key.
2- The player has to press the same key.
3- Next, the Simon turns back the same light on and a second one, again randomly.
4- The player has to reproduce this chain of light using his memory.
5- And so on... In each round a new key is added to the series and the game becomes all the more difficult as the player's memory is put to the test.
6- If the player doesn't make any mistake, the game goes on, so it is an endless game!"*
