# Max Curkovic's "Simon" Game Recreatuib

This website serves as a recreation of the classic memory game "Simon", written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS code. 
Below are the rules of the game, paraphrased from: https://www.memozor.com/simon-games/simon-game#simon_rules

"The principle of the game is simple: the player have to memorize a pattern of illuminated keys and reproduce it. The purpose of the game is to reproduce the longest series of colors / sounds randomly generated by Simon.
In each round a new key is added to the pattern and the game becomes increasingly difficult.

1- At the beginning of the game, one of the 4 keys lights up randomly producing simultaneously a sound associated to the key.

2- The player has to press the same key.

3- Next, Simon will light up another color. The user must repeat the same pattern: first color, THEN second color.

4- More colors are added afterwards... in each round a new key is added to the series and the game becomes all the more difficult as the player's memory is put to the test.

5- If the player doesn't make any mistake, the game goes on, so it is an endless game!"
